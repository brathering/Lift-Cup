This is a fork of the tool Lift Cup made by midgetspy.

What is Lift Cup?
==================
Lift Cup is a python script that automatically uploads video files to usenet for you.


What exactly does this modified version do?
============================
1) Rars the files with a veiled name and set password if needed
2) Creates pars from the rars
3) Uploads the rars and pars to the usenet
4) Exports nzb files with SabNZB compatible names


How to install
====================

1) Get the source
git clone git://github.com/midgetspy/Lift-Cup.git ~/lift_cup

2) Install dependencies:
* rar
* par2
* newsmangler (git clone git://github.com/madcowfred/newsmangler.git ~/newsmangler)

3) Set up config
* rename conf.py.sample to conf.py
* configure the options inside to match your system


Usage
===================

# Watch dirs
# Note: every watch dir must have d.set_custom5=<something>, where <something> is either a Lift Cup quality, blank, or SKIP.
schedule = watch_directory_1,10,10,"load_start=/home/midgetspy/watch_dir/*.torrent,d.set_custom5=SKIP" # this won't have Lift Cup executed on it
schedule = watch_directory_2,10,10,"load_start=/home/midgetspy/watch_dir/hd_bluray_watch_dir/*.torrent,d.set_custom5=HDBLURAY" # unless the filename says otherwise files in this folder will be assumed to be 720p BluRay

# execute lift cup after each download
system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,lift_cup,"execute=/home/midgetspy/rtorrent_lc.py,$d.get_base_path=,$d.get_custom5="

Note: ALL watch dirs must have d.set_custom5= in them or they will error! You will need to update your existing watch dirs!



Call it manually

./lc.py <file1> [file2] ... [fileN]

Run just ./lc.py with no options to see all other options.


Newsmangler Config
====================

In order to get your files detected on the automatic indexing sites you should use the [Lift-Cup] prefix and post to alt.binaries.multimedia.

So your resulting posts should look something like:

[LiftCup] Cookery.School.s01e43.andyx.tbz.HDTV.XviD [35/35] - "Cookery.School.s01e43.andyx.tbz.HDTV.XviD.vol126+74.par2" yEnc
